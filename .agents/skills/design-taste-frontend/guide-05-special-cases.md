## Special cases

**An existing brand or design system.** Pass `--keep palette,type`, map the brand's colours and faces
onto the roles, and take only composition from the draw. The house rules still apply; if the brand
itself requires a banned device (its logo sits in a gradient, its accent is violet), keep the brand
asset, say so in the report, and pass `--allow <rule>` to the inspector for that rule only.

**Redesign or review of an existing page.** Run `lint.mjs` and `inspect.mjs` on it first and report
what they find, then critique the screenshots with `references/critique.md`. For a redesign, draw a
direction and proceed from step 2, keeping the page's real content and working behaviour.

**A component or a single section, not a page.** Skip the draw unless there is no direction to follow.
Match the surrounding design, apply the house rules and the laws, and still inspect the result.

**No checkout, no form backend.** The primary button goes to the real destination when the brief names
one. Otherwise it opens an email with a written subject and body (`mailto:` with the visitor's choices
filled in), or, for a shop, it points at `#checkout` and the report says it must be wired before
launch. Never fake a payment form.

**No Chrome or Node 22.** Run `lint.mjs` (Node 18+), take screenshots with whatever browser tool you
have, and critique those. Say in the report that the inspector could not run.

**No network.** If `assets.mjs` reaches no source, draw the pictures and say in the report that the
open collections could not be searched.
