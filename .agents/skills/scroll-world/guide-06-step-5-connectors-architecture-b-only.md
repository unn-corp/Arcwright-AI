## Step 5 — Connectors (architecture B only)

Skip this whole step for architecture **A** — the forward take has no connectors; its legs
already chain seamlessly. This step applies to **B** (diorama/miniature), and note the
reversal caveat from Step 4.

The connector clips are what make the world feel *connected* instead of cut. A connector
flies from the end of scene i out and into the start of scene i+1. **Both of its
endpoints must be the ACTUAL RENDERED FRAMES of the neighbouring clips — never the
original diorama still.**

Why: every Higgsfield generation renders slightly differently. If a connector *ends* on
a fresh render of "the kitchen diorama," but the next dive clip *starts* on its own
different render of that same diorama, the two won't match and you get a pop at the seam.
The fix is to hand off the exact pixels:

```
For each connector between dive_i and dive_{i+1}:
  start-image = the LAST frame extracted from dive_i's rendered video
  end-image   = the FIRST frame extracted from dive_{i+1}'s rendered video
```

Now every seam is frame-identical on *both* sides:
`dive_i.end == connector.start` and `connector.end == dive_{i+1}.start`.

Extract the boundary frames from the rendered dives (not the stills):

```bash
ffmpeg -sseof -0.15 -i dive_i.mp4   -frames:v 1 -q:v 2 dive_i_last.png    # interior of i
ffmpeg -ss 0      -i dive_{i+1}.mp4 -frames:v 1 -q:v 2 dive_next_first.png # establishing of i+1
```

Generate the connector (`--duration 5` is plenty). Connectors need `--end-image`, so the
model must accept it — any roster model does (`seedance_2_0`, `seedance_2_0_mini`,
`kling3_0`):

```bash
higgsfield generate create "$VMODEL" \
  --prompt "$(cat connector_i.txt)" \
  --start-image dive_i_last.png --end-image dive_next_first.png \
  $VOPTS --aspect_ratio 16:9 --duration 5 --wait --json
# seedance: VOPTS="--mode std --resolution 1080p"; kling3_0: VOPTS="--mode std --sound off"
```

Connector prompt: "Single continuous camera move, no cuts. Pull up and back out of
<scene i>, rise into the sky, glide across the connected miniature world, and arrive
above <scene i+1>, beginning to descend toward it. Seamless flowing aerial transition.
<style>. No text." (Template in `references/prompts.md`.)

Insurance: Seedance lands *close* to the end-image but not always pixel-perfect, so the
engine still applies a **short crossfade** (a few frames) at each seam. Frame-matched
endpoints + a small crossfade = no visible cut. Never skip the actual-frame handoff and
rely on the crossfade alone; a big content jump can't be hidden by a crossfade.

Whether a handoff actually held is **machine-checkable** — don't wait for the browser
QA to find out. After encoding, run the SSIM seam check (`references/pipeline.md` §5c):
a true actual-frame handoff scores ≥0.95 across the boundary; <0.75 means an endpoint
was a still or the wrong frame. Run it again after every re-roll — replacing one clip
silently touches BOTH of its seams.
