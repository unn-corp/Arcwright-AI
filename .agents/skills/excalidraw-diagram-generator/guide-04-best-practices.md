## Best Practices

For compact flowchart, swimlane, sequence, architecture, and mind-map recipes,
see [diagram-patterns.md](diagram-patterns.md). Match the project's theme.

### Element Count Guidelines

| Diagram Type | Recommended Count | Maximum |
|--------------|-------------------|---------|
| Flowchart steps | 3-10 | 15 |
| Relationship entities | 3-8 | 12 |
| Mind map branches | 4-6 | 8 |
| Mind map sub-topics per branch | 2-4 | 6 |

### Layout Tips

1. **Start positions**: Center important elements, use consistent spacing
2. **Spacing**: 
   - Horizontal gap: 200-300px between elements
   - Vertical gap: 100-150px between rows
3. **Colors**: Use consistent color scheme
   - Primary elements: Light blue (`#a5d8ff`)
   - Secondary elements: Light green (`#b2f2bb`)
   - Important/Central: Yellow (`#ffd43b`)
   - Alerts/Warnings: Light red (`#ffc9c9`)
4. **Text sizing**: 16-24px for readability
5. **Font**: Always use `fontFamily: 5` (Excalifont) for all text elements
6. **Arrow style**: Use straight arrows for simple flows, curved for complex relationships

### Complexity Management

**If user request has too many elements:**
- Suggest breaking into multiple diagrams
- Focus on main elements first
- Offer to create detailed sub-diagrams

**Example response:**
```
"Your request includes 15 components. For clarity, I recommend:
1. High-level architecture diagram (6 main components)
2. Detailed diagram for each subsystem

Would you like me to start with the high-level view?"
```
