## When a widget beats plain text

Don't add UI for its own sake — most tools are fine returning text or JSON. Add a widget when one of these is true:

| Signal | Widget type |
|---|---|
| Tool needs structured input the model can't reliably infer | Form |
| User must pick from a list the model can't rank (files, contacts, records) | Picker / table |
| Destructive or billable action needs explicit confirmation | Confirm dialog |
| Output is spatial or visual (charts, maps, diffs, previews) | Display widget |
| Long-running job the user wants to watch | Progress / live status |

If none apply, skip the widget. Text is faster to build and faster for the user.
