## Widget runtime — the `App` class

Inside the iframe, your script talks to the host via the `App` class from `@modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps`. This is a **persistent bidirectional connection** — the widget stays alive as long as the conversation is active, receiving new tool results and sending user actions.

```html
<script type="module">
  /* ext-apps bundle inlined at build time → globalThis.ExtApps */
  /*__EXT_APPS_BUNDLE__*/
  const { App } = globalThis.ExtApps;

  const app = new App({ name: "ContactPicker", version: "1.0.0" }, {});

  // Set handlers BEFORE connecting
  app.ontoolresult = ({ content }) => {
    const contacts = JSON.parse(content[0].text);
    render(contacts);
  };

  await app.connect();

  // Later, when the user clicks something:
  function onPick(contact) {
    app.sendMessage({
      role: "user",
      content: [{ type: "text", text: `Selected contact: ${contact.id}` }],
    });
  }
</script>
```

The `/*__EXT_APPS_BUNDLE__*/` placeholder gets replaced by the server at startup with the contents of `@modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps/app-with-deps` — see `references/iframe-sandbox.md` for why this is necessary and the rewrite snippet. **Do not** `import { App } from "https://esm.sh/..."`; the iframe's CSP blocks the transitive dependency fetches and the widget renders blank.

| Method | Direction | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| `app.ontoolresult = fn` | Host → widget | Receive the tool's return value |
| `app.ontoolinput = fn` | Host → widget | Receive the tool's input args (what the model passed) |
| `app.sendMessage({...})` | Widget → host | Inject a message into the conversation |
| `app.updateModelContext({...})` | Widget → host | Update context silently (no visible message) |
| `app.callServerTool({name, arguments})` | Widget → server | Call another tool on your server |
| `app.openLink({url})` | Widget → host | Open a URL in a new tab (sandbox blocks `window.open`) |
| `app.getHostContext()` / `app.onhostcontextchanged` | Host → widget | Theme, host CSS vars, `containerDimensions`, `displayMode`, `deviceCapabilities` |
| `app.requestDisplayMode({mode})` | Widget → host | Ask for `inline` / `pip` / `fullscreen` |
| `app.downloadFile({name, mimeType, content})` | Widget → host | Host-mediated download (base64 content) |
| `new App(info, caps, {autoResize: true})` | — | Iframe height tracks rendered content |

`sendMessage` is the typical "user picked something, tell the model" path. `updateModelContext` is for state that the model should know about but shouldn't clutter the chat. `openLink` is **required** for any outbound navigation — `window.open` and `<a target="_blank">` are blocked by the sandbox attribute.

**What widgets cannot do:**
- Access the host page's DOM, cookies, or storage
- Make network calls to arbitrary origins (CSP-restricted — route through `callServerTool`)
- Open popups or navigate directly — use `app.openLink({url})`
- Load remote images reliably — inline as `data:` URLs server-side

Keep widgets **small and single-purpose**. A picker picks. A chart displays. Don't build a whole sub-app inside the iframe — split it into multiple tools with focused widgets.
